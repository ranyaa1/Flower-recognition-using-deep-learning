# Flower-recognition-using-deep-learning

Excited to announce our successful practical session titled 'Flower Image Recognition Using Deep Learning' in our machine learning course for research master studies under the esteemed guidance of Professor Olfa Jemai, alongside my colleague Insaf ChaibiðŸŒ¸

In this session, we'll delve into the fascinating world of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and explore the power of transfer learning using renowned architectures like VGG16, Inception V3, and ResNet50. After careful consideration, we've opted for ResNet50 due to its superior performance in image recognition tasks.

For implementation, we've decided to harness the simplicity and efficiency of Flask, leveraging it as an API for seamless integration and interaction with our models.
